Key points : 
- implementation of Map. 
- stores only weak references to its keys. 

Weak references : the objects that are referenced only by weak references are garbage collected eagerly; the GC won't wait until it needs memory in that case. 

Difference between Hashmap and WeakHashMap: If the java memory manager no longer has a strong reference to the object specified as a key, then the entry in the map will be removed in WeakHashMap.
